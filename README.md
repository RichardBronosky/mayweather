# 🐱 Mayweather the cat 🐈 404-992-7866

Meow, I'm Mayweather Matheson. Don't let my small size and boney appearance confuse you. I have constant access to Fancy Feast Gravy Lovers food, lovingly blended to a thin consistency. 😻 I'm living my best life.

## Age

I'm estimated to be over 18 years old. I've been with my current humans since 2014. Before that I hung around a cat horder in Atlanta, GA with 60+ other cats.

## Vet

I have a vet. I don't need yours.

## Life, Love, and Happiness

I'm miserable 😿 when kept in doors. (Even more so when kept in a cage, so PLEASE don't take me to a shelter or a vet.) I have a "doggie door" 😻 at my home on the corner of 📍 W Webster and N Dayton 🧭 in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago.

People on the sidewalk are so friendly to me 😸 that I can't help but aproach them. But some people try and be helpful and take me to the Veternary Emergency Group 😾 where they scan my microchip and call my human. They mean the best, but it really sucks for me.

In 2014 my vet said I had 2-3 years left to live. I've proven them wrong! 😺 But when you put me in a cage "for my own good", it makes me wish I were dead. 🙀 So please, love me, but don't take me. I have 💉 VERY SPECIFIC NEEDS 💉 that have taken me years to teach my human. I can't go through that again.
